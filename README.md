Jarvis: AI-Powered Virtual Assistant
Welcome to the Jarvis repository! This project is a full-stack AI-powered virtual assistant inspired by the iconic J.A.R.V.I.S. from Iron Man. It combines a dynamic front-end user interface with a robust back-end powered by LangChain and advanced speech processing.

Features
Interactive User Interface:

A clean and modern front-end built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Animations for "listening" and "speaking" states, creating a responsive user experience.
Advanced Back-End:

Powered by LangChain for natural language processing and memory management.
Integrated with Deepgram for live transcription of user speech.
Eleven Labs or Deepgram TTS for text-to-speech synthesis with support for voices like British Male.
Real-Time Communication:

WebSocket-based communication for seamless interaction between the front-end and back-end.
Supports both continuous conversation and command-based input (e.g., "goodbye" to terminate).
Configurable and Scalable:

Easy integration with new APIs or models.
Configurable environment variables for keys and settings.

Usage
Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:5000.
Speak into the microphone. The assistant will listen and respond based on the processed input.
Use the animated circle UI for visual feedback during interactions.
To stop the interaction, say "goodbye," and the assistant will terminate gracefully.
Technologies Used
Back-End:
LangChain: For LLM-based conversation processing.
Deepgram: For real-time speech-to-text transcription.
Eleven Labs: For text-to-speech synthesis.
Python: Core language for back-end development.
Flask: Serves the front-end and WebSocket API.
Front-End:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Core front-end technologies.
WebSockets: Real-time communication between the front-end and back-end.
